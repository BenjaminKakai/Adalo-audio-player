# Adalo-audio-player
This program is designed to work with the Adalo app builder and allows users to play audio files in their mobile or web application.

# Getting Started
To use this program, you will need to have an Adalo account and an app set up in Adalo. Once you have your app set up, follow these steps:

Open the Adalo app builder and navigate to the screen where you want to add the audio player.
Add an Audio Player component to the screen and give it a name.
In the component settings, upload the audio file you want to play.
Customize the appearance of the audio player using the component settings.
Add actions to the audio player to control the playback of the audio file, such as play, pause, stop, and seek.
If you want to allow users to play multiple audio files, you can add a list to the screen to display a collection of audio files, and use the Audio Player component as a list item.
